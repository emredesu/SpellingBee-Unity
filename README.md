# SpellingBee-Unity
A spelling bee game with customizable questions made with Unity and C# in 6 hours overnight through the power of coffee. 

### Question: How do I add my own questions?
Go to Assets/StreamingAssets and edit questions.json. Make sure that you do not damage the .json structure, and that your question follows the same "question", "wordType", "answer", "pointValue" and "timeGiven" structure.
You can add as many questions as you'd like! After you are done, save the .json file and launch the game again. If the first question is not an error message, you did it!
